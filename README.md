# Flash-cards

These are the flashcards I used to prepare for exams at my university.

# Randomised

To do well on this exam, you need to basically memorise every card in the deck.
The deck is complete WRT the content I studied, but you may need to add more cards.

# Complexity

This exam is fundamentally about understanding, but the lecturer does expect you to memorise the definitions of problems, and there is some recall for the very last part on approximation algorithms.
IIRC this deck is not complete, so you will need to create more cards.

# MML
The exam is basically a copy and paste every year. 
I didn't realise this, so in actuality this deck won't be super useful.
You would need to create further cards for basically every exam question that has every come up (there are 3 exams so not that many).

# CLT

This deck is incomplete, but the exam is really easy.

# Neural Computing

This deck is mostly complete.
